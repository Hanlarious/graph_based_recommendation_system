The one touch motor only operates as long as you hold the button and turns off when released.', \"This electric device eliminates the embarrassment of stepping out from home or office with unpolished shoes. It polishes and buffs men's and women's shoes in just seconds--and it doesn't require bending over. Because the push-button on/off control is on top of a chrome post 32-1/2 inches high, the polisher can be operated while standing. Two polishing muffs--black for black shoes, red for other colors--slip onto large cones that ensure quick work when powered by the high-torque, 60-watt motor. Either after applying polish to shoes or just for buffing, the muffs provide a high, professional-quality shine. The muffs can be replaced when they wear out. The polisher is heavy and stable. It assembles quickly with just two Phillips head screws, which are included, and carries a one-year warranty against defects. <I>--Fred Brack</I>\"], 'fit': '', 'title': 'First Class Electric Shoe Polisher', 'also_buy': [], 'image': [], 'tech2': '', 'brand': 'Jerdon', 'feature': [], 'rank': '2,532,810 in Beauty & Personal Care (', 'also_view': [], 'details': {'\\n    Product Dimensions: \\n    ': '18 x 8 x 33 inches', 'Shipping Weight:': '9.2 pounds', 'Domestic Shipping: ': 'Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.
